🖨️ Raspberry Pi Wireless Print Server

This project demonstrates how to convert a Raspberry Pi into a wireless print server that works seamlessly with USB printers such as the HP LaserJet Professional P1106. It enables wireless printing from Windows 11 devices and Android smartphones over a local Wi-Fi network — without relying on proprietary mobile apps or cloud services.

📘 Project Overview

Many older printers, though still functional, lack wireless capability. This project provides a cost-effective and open-source solution by using:

- 🧠 Raspberry Pi as the server
- ⚙️ CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) for managing print jobs
- 🖨️ HPLIP for HP printer driver support
- 🌐 IPP/Mopria Print Service for mobile compatibility

Once set up, the Raspberry Pi acts as a wireless print server that can accept print requests from multiple devices on the same network.

✨ Key Features

- ✅ Wireless printing from laptops and Android phones
- ✅ No need for external software or cloud printing
- ✅ Simple setup via web browser (CUPS interface)
- ✅ Automatically reconnects after reboot or power loss
- ✅ Compatible with most USB printers
